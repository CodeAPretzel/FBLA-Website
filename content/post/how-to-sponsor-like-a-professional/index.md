Sponsoring other businesses for Marionville FBLA can be a mutually beneficial partnership. When wanting to contact a business for a sponsorship, there are three key points to consider:

1. **Identify the Value Proposition:** Before approaching potential sponsors, it's crucial to clearly define the value your school's FBLA chapter can offer. Highlight the benefits of sponsorship, such as brand exposure, community engagement, and the opportunity to support education. Showcase your chapter's achievements, goals, and how their contribution can make an impact. Create a compelling sponsorship proposal that outlines these details.
2. **Remain Calm and Collective:** When wanting to gain a sponsor, ensure that you are calm to the person you are speaking with, collective of your thoughts and ideas, and illustrate your point for sponsoring fully. If you are nervous about speaking to the business manager, take deep breaths, imagine the scenario in your head, and collect your thoughts into an organized speech.
3. **Retain Professionalism:** After securing sponsorships, maintain professionalism through consistent, but respectful follow-ups. Send personalized thank-you notes expressing gratitude for their support and emphasizing how their partnership is vital to your chapter's success. If the business agrees to sponsor, confirm the details in writing to ensure clarity and alignment. When sponsorship payment arrives, send a confirmation that acknowledges Marionville FBLA has officially received their sponsorship.

By following these steps, you can successfully attract and retain sponsorships, enabling our chapter to thrive while benefiting the local business community!
