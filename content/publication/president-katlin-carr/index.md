I'm Katlin Carr, serving as the FBLA president. As a senior at Marionville, I've dedicated all four years of high school to FBLA, with two years as an officer and one as president. Beyond FBLA, I'm actively engaged in various school clubs like FCA, FCCLA, FTA, Student Council, and NHS. Additionally, I participate in softball, golf, and cheer. In my free time, you'll often find me enjoying coffee with friends, lost in a good book, and scrolling on TikTok.
