Owen Bright is responsible for FBLA's events, gathering info for our competitions, and suggesting competition material for members. As a kind and full-hearty man, Owen is the perfect guy to engage and have a great time with. This year, as a senior, he is putting all his effort and hard work into showing FBLA and its members what he has to offer.
