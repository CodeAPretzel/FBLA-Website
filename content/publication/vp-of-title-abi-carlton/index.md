Hello! My name is Abi Carlton, and I am in 11th grade. I have been an FBLA member for three years! I enjoy doing things for my community and connecting with others. I have been a Comet for most of my life and love it. I love spending time with my family and friends, but most of all, I love to shop. My favorite colors are blue and pink, and I love to watch Pitch Perfect. I am so excited about this year's upcoming FBLA program, and I look forward to getting to know everyone!
