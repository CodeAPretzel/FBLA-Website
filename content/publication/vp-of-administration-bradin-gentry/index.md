B﻿radin loves how socially active he has become since joining FBLA and the fact that in only one year, he has made so many new friends!

H﻿e is looking forward to hopefully placing in the year's districts and maybe even going to state!

B﻿esides volleyball, FBLA is the only thing he is involved in so far, Bradin is hoping to join more clubs this upcoming year!

O﻿ne thing about him is he's always open for criticism and help with anything he is doing!
