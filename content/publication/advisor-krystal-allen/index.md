I am Ms. Allen, the FBLA adviser. I also teach business classes, computer science, mass media, and I'm the head volleyball coach. This is my 5th year with Marionville FBLA, and I have loved every minute. In the last two years, we have taken over 30 students to FBLA state, and in June 2023, we took three students to Nationals in Atlanta, GA. I love this club and how much it has grown over the years I have been here.
