As a member of FBLA and its communications, I'm responsible for relaying information, events, and topics to the community and our Marionville FBLA members. Most of my passions are computer-related topics and neuroscience, but I also like hiking and exploring nature. This year, I would have been in FBLA for three years, and I've enjoyed every bit of it, and even more each year. I know we have a lot of activities planned this year, and can't wait to have them underway!
