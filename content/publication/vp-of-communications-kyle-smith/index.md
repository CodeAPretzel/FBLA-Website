K﻿yle loves that with FBLA, we get to network with businesses, compete in competitions to learn, and develop relations with our peers.

H﻿e hopes that this year in FBLA we'll be able to achieve some of the Gold Level Chapter requirements FBLA wants for their chapters!

O﻿ther than FBLA, he is the founder of the Cybersecurity Club, CyberELITES. This is where you learn through hands-on technology topics and compete in events. He is also involved in Marionville's NHS where they do community activities.

S﻿omething about Kyle is that he is interested in computer technologies and neuroscience, but also enjoys the outdoors; traveling and trailing along nature paths.
