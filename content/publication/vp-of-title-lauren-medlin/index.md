Hello! My name is Lauren Medlin, and I am this yearâ€™s Vice President of Social Media. I joined FBLA as a freshman for the fun of it, but I have learned so much throughout the years! Along with being in FBLA, I also participate in FCA, Student Council, National Honors Society, volleyball, and track. I am currently a senior, and I plan to attend Evangel University after I graduate. I hope everyone loves FBLA as much as I do and can learn more about how to be a business leader!
