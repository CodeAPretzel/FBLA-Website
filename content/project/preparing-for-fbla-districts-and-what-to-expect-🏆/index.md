When competing at FBLA Districts, there are **THREE** main categories for success at these competitions, depending on what event you're competing for. 

The first is *General Performance*. General Performance is how the participant should act when attending districts and competing in an event. The second category is *Performance and Role Play*. Performance and Role Play is an event category where you have a prompt and perform in front of the FBLA judges. Finally, the third category is *Project-Based*. Project-Based is another event category where the FBLA participant is given a subject to build and demonstrate a project they've prepared for the FBLA judges.

IÔªøn this guide, we will give general tips and tricks for making it to the top placements in districts and competing in FBLA State:

_Ôªø

### General Performance

* DÔªøress professional. Make sure to wear your FBLA-approved attire throughout the entire day.
* EÔªønsure you've read the guidelines and rating sheet for your events.
* IÔªøf you have an event, you need to practice. Make sure to take time to practice when you have to perform in front of judges!
* CÔªøontact previous members who've competed in your event. They might have additional information that may be useful.

### Performance and Role Play

* When walking into a room of judges, **shake their hands and introduce yourself** stating your name, school, state, and project/title. Speak professionally, have good eye contact, smile, and sound confident.
* IÔªøf you have a Q&A performance with your event, make sure that you are thinking of questions and answers beforehand so that you don't get stumped when asked a **surprise** question.

### Project-Based

* IÔªøf you are show-casing a project at FBLA Districts, make sure that you've prepared and are ready to present to the judges!
